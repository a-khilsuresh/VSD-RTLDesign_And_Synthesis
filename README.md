# VSD-RTLDesign_And_Synthesis

🔧This repository documents learnings and lab work from the “RTL Design using Verilog with Sky130"

**📘 About This Repo**

- Writing and simulating RTL designs using Verilog

*Running functional simulations with Icarus Verilog and visualizing waveforms in GTKWave

*Performing logic synthesis with Yosys and the Sky130 open-source process design kit

*Hands on practice using Linux terminal or open-source FPGA environments

*Understanding core concepts like:*
*Basics of Verilog Coding
*Testbench creation
*Standard cell libraries and their verilog modules
*D Flip-Flop styles
*Hold and setup time concepts
*Basic optimization techniques
*if-else, case, for, and generate statements
*Gate level Synthesis
*Inferred Latches
*Simulation and Synthesis mismatch

*Installed tools:*
*git for version control
*iverilog for compiling Verilog
*gtkwave for viewing simulation waveforms
*yosys for logic synthesis
Any code editor (e.g., VS Code, Vim, Nano)
